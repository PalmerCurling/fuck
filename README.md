# Fuck

a web-scale implementation of the fuck command

Working on a project?
Need to give fucks?

Just do it then!

Add an alias to your bashrc so when you type "fuck" it runs the fuck.py.

#TODO
*Add a DB to actually store values of 5 most recent names+total number of fucks ever given

visit http://fucks.herokuapp.com/ to see fucks given!
