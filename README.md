# Fuck

a web-scale implementation of the fuck command

Working on a project?
Need to give fucks?

Just do it then!

Add an alias to your bashrc so when you type "fuck" it runs the fuck.py.
(or just drop fuck.py into your local bin.)

#TODO
Setup new server location, since heroku doesnt support sqlite3; array based version at fucks.herokuapp.com.
This array clears out when the app sleeps, so this version is considered depricated
